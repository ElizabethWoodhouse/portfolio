<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
I have had the pleasure of working in retail helping big box retailers plan for merchandise both within the store and on the e-commerce platform for the past 5 years.
During my time in retail I took on projects that centered around building tools in excel to help teams better manage their business and create efficiencies.
In 2020, I made the decision to make a career transition to focus full-time on improving people's lives through technology at a larger scale.
